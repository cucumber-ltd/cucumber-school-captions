00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.152
Welcome back to cucumber School

2
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.064
Last time we went from cleaning up the shotty features to keep them in sync with the current states to the project

3
00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:30.464
We strip the scenarios back to only specify the behavior of passing messages between people

4
00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:35.328
We made it clear that the proximity rule had not yet been implemented

5
00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:43.008
You remember from the regular expressions lesson how important it is to be expressive in your scenarios

6
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:44.800
I keep them readable

7
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:51.968
And this episode we going to learn some new tricks with keratin that will give you even more flexibility

8
00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:54.016
About how you write scenarios

9
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.832
Once again

10
00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:58.624
The Shanty Pixies

11
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.024
I mean the shotty developers having hard work implementing a proximity rule

12
00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:08.352
Let's have a look at how they got on

13
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.824
Right so those two scenarios we just left as placeholders the one by the listener

14
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.224
Is within range and the one where the listener is out of range having flushed out on app

15
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.992
Passing

16
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.040
Fantastic

17
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.160
Let's review the changes to the feature file and more detail

18
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:36.256
We now have full scenarios

19
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:41.888
Original two from the last time we looked at the code and two new ones

20
00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:47.264
With the two new ones fleshed-out we can say that the first scenario we wrote

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.824
The one where they listen to hear the message

22
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.128
Is identical to the third one

23
00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:55.200
The 1Weather listener is within range

24
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.296
Keeping excess cenarios is wasteful

25
00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:04.416
They clutter up your feet two files distracting your readers

26
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.584
When you run your features as tests excess cenarios make them take longer to run than necessary

27
00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:19.520
The one where the listener is within range is a perfectly good way of checking that the message has been sent correctly

28
00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:22.080
Let's remove the other one

29
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.504
Similarly we no longer really need to be testing multiple messages

30
00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:36.416
We use the test to triangulate and forces to replace the hard-coded

31
00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:37.696
Message output

32
00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:39.744
With a proper implementation

33
00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:44.096
Now we have a demand model that uses a variable for the message

34
00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:47.424
Does an insignificant chance of this Behavior regressing

35
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.240
So we can safely remove the test

36
00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:56.384
So now we're down to two scenarios that illustrate this rule about proximity

37
00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:59.712
The one with the listener is within range

38
00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:03.296
And the one where the listener is out of range

39
00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:10.208
Will using two different listeners Lucy is always within range and Larry

40
00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:11.232
His note

41
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:14.048
It's always show on who's doing the shouting

42
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.144
We create all three people here in the background

43
00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:21.728
Notice that we also specify the range hair

44
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
We could have just had coded it within the system

45
00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:31.200
Having a documented here in this scenario helps to make the behavior with specified much easier to understand

46
00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:38.112
A happy side effect is that in order to set the range from a scenario we have to make it to confirm

47
00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.160
Terrible property of the system

48
00:03:40.672 --> 00:03:46.816
So if a business stakeholders ever change their minds about the range we won't have to go hunting around in the code so why we talk

49
00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:51.680
Not coded it notice how the steps that create the three people are very similar

50
00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:59.616
Let me see steps like this given when then syntax starts to feel a bit clunky

51
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.736
Imagine if we could just write out a table like this

52
00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:21.631
Well we're in luck you can

53
00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:28.799
Duncan has a special syntax called data tables that allows you to specify tablet

54
00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:34.431
Data for step using pipe characters to mop the boundary between cells

55
00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:44.415
Has he can say the step definition of Felicity takes a single argument which has this coming to explains

56
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.743
Is a cucumber API datatable

57
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:52.607
This object has a rich API for using the tabular data

58
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:58.495
At its most basic the table is just a two-dimensional array of arrays

59
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.551
You can also turn the table into a list of map

60
00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:17.951
Where the first row is used for the map keys at each following row is used for the map values

61
00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:25.631
Now we can easily answer right over these maps and turn them into instances of person

62
00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:41.759
Without done we can delete our old step definition which is now unused

63
00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:53.535
Cucumber strips pull the white space surrounding each cell so we can have a nice neat table into cooking but still

64
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.351
Clean values in the steppe definition underneath

65
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:05.823
Note to self still have to convert the location from a string to an integer because cucumber a cop know that's the type of file you in

66
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.847
Dinner table

67
00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:12.223
If you have a class that has the same field names at the header Row in the table

68
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.343
You can have cucumber automatically convert the table into a list of. Class

69
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:23.999
If a person object has name and location fields and didn't take it in terms of networking its Constructor

70
00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:28.607
We could automatically create instances of person from the stable

71
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.679
Things aren't always that simple

72
00:06:32.703 --> 00:06:38.847
Instead will Define a simple whereabouts class to represent the data in the table

73
00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:46.015
Flea medicine in a class to the steppe definition class as it doesn't fall apart about codomain

74
00:06:46.783 --> 00:06:52.927
Now we can use the as list method on the data table to convert the table into a list of

75
00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:54.207
Whereabouts

76
00:06:55.487 --> 00:06:59.583
In fact you don't have to explicitly convert the table to a list

77
00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:05.983
If you declare your parameter as a generic list cucumber will automatically convert the table into

78
00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.543
To the list of the generic type for you

79
00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:15.711
Now the way you specified this data is okay but it's quite hard to visualize but

80
00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:17.503
Age of the papers stud

81
00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:21.599
It might be better to express it like this instead

82
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.671
Do you like that better

83
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.535
You too but you're worried I will handle it and I step definition

84
00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:31.839
See a note

85
00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:34.399
Cucumber has you covered

86
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:38.495
If you annotate the method parameter

87
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.311
With a transpose annotation

88
00:07:41.823 --> 00:07:46.687
Cucumber water in each row into a column before passing it to the steppe definition

89
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:54.111
You can also call the transpose method on the data table directly to explicitly create a new Tron

90
00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:55.647
Transpose datatable

91
00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:08.959
Datatables a very useful for setting up data and given steps

92
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:12.543
But you can also use them for specifying outcomes

93
00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:18.943
One rule that we've been implying but it never actually explode with an example

94
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:23.551
Is that people remember everything they Hood

95
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:30.463
So far we've only specified a single message so let's try writing a scenario by Sean Shout

96
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:31.999
More than once

97
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:39.423
See how natural it is to use a datatable here

98
00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:46.847
We also haven't used any color matters in this case since the data is all in a single column anyway

99
00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:50.687
So how do we implement the steppe definition

100
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:57.855
Well the datatable has a really handy mesical death that we can use to compare

101
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.159
Have two datatables

102
00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:04.255
This will pass if the tables are the same

103
00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.303
I say this a different

104
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:14.495
So we need the actual messages that loses her to be stored in an object that looks like a datatable so we

105
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:17.567
We can compare it to the ones we expect

106
00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:23.967
A list of list of string will do so we can just it's right over Lucy's messages I created you

107
00:09:24.223 --> 00:09:26.271
Single item list for each row

108
00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:33.183
Now we can pass that list to the death message on the table of expected messages passed in from the garage

109
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:42.911
Whoops it looks like we made it typo in Austin area

110
00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:47.519
We should have included exclamation marks on the expected messages

111
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:54.175
Well at least it gives you a chance to see the nice def output from cucumber when the tables a different

112
00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:00.831
Received the expected values prefix for the minus and the actual values prefix of the

113
00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:01.855
Plus

114
00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:07.743
Let's fix just one of these so you can see how the diff output changes

115
00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:15.679
Matching Bagels line no longer has a minus for the miss spectro the actual Valley Steel

116
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:18.751
Doesn't - unexpected body has a plus

117
00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:23.359
Let's fix this last typo. should be green again

118
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.943
Great

119
00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:33.599
When writing scenarios occasionally we want to use a really long piece of data

120
00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.647
For example

121
00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:40.511
Let's introduce a new rule about the maximum length of a message

122
00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:45.375
Another scenario to illustrate it

123
00:10:45.887 --> 00:10:49.215
Making the string just over the boundary of the rule

124
00:10:54.335 --> 00:10:59.967
That's pretty ugly isn't it still will press on and get it to Green

125
00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:02.271
Demo show you how to clean it up

126
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:08.159
Existing step definition ugly step with a long message just fine

127
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:12.511
Tell me the news. Definition for this last outcome step

128
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:19.167
Well it's right of all the people in the scenario and check to haven't heard this message

129
00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.551
Okay so we have a failing acceptance test

130
00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:38.623
Best dive down into a solution and implement this new rule

131
00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:46.047
It seems like the network should be responsible for implementing this rule so let's go to its unit test

132
00:11:46.303 --> 00:11:50.143
I got a new example to specify this extra responsibility

133
00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:08.575
Will create a 181 character message like this

134
00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:12.415
Play solution shown in the usual positions

135
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:14.719
Subscribe Lacey to the network

136
00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:19.327
Anna said that Lucy should not hear the message when it's broadcast

137
00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.423
Let's run that test

138
00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:26.239
Good it fails

139
00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:29.823
This is still getting the message at the moment

140
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.407
The how we got to implement this

141
00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:39.039
It looks like we're already implementing the proximity rule here in the broadcast method

142
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.879
That's another if statement here about the message length

143
00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:46.207
From the unit test again

144
00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:47.999
Highest passing

145
00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:49.279
Great

146
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:54.143
It's got a little bit messy and hard to read

147
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.727
130 basic movie we could make to improve it

148
00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:01.567
Would be to just extract a couple of temporary variables

149
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.783
That's better

150
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:16.415
This car to be improved even further of course but at least we haven't made it any worse

151
00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:19.487
Let's just run the test to check

152
00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:22.559
Great everything's still green

153
00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:30.239
Now have everything passing again we can toddy of the gherkin to use a new piece of syntax we've been wanting to tell you

154
00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:31.007
About

155
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.055
Adult string

156
00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:40.479
Cox trains allow you to specify text argument. That's tons of a multiple lines

157
00:13:41.247 --> 00:13:43.807
We could change our step to look like this instead

158
00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:49.439
Now the scenario is much more readable

159
00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:52.767
We don't use dogs drink very often

160
00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:57.375
I think such a lot of dates are in a test cutoff to make it quite brittle

161
00:13:57.887 --> 00:14:01.471
But when you do need it it's useful to know about

162
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:17.343
You might have noticed that we follow the patent when we added Behavior to the system during this episode

163
00:14:17.855 --> 00:14:23.999
First Express the behavior we wanted in a gherkin scenario why don't the stepdad

164
00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:27.839
Definitions and run cucumber to watch it fail

165
00:14:28.607 --> 00:14:34.751
Then we found the first class and not the main model that needed to change in order

166
00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.055
With the support that new Behavior

167
00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:40.895
In this case the network class

168
00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:46.783
We use the unit test to describe how we wanted instances of that class to behave

169
00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:50.623
Can we run the unit test and wants to fail

170
00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:57.279
We focusing on my changes to the class until it's unit test for passing

171
00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:04.191
When the unit test for passing which I made some minor changes to clean up the code and make

172
00:15:04.447 --> 00:15:05.471
Make it more readable

173
00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:09.823
This is the basic test-driven development cycle

174
00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:11.359
Red

175
00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:14.175
Green clean

176
00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:20.319
The technical name for this last cleanup step is refactoring

177
00:15:20.575 --> 00:15:25.695
Refactoring is an ugly name for an extremely valuable activity

178
00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:31.839
Improving the design of existing code without changing its Behavior

179
00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:37.471
You can think about it like cleaning up and washing the dishes after you've prepared a meal

180
00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:40.031
Basic housekeeping

181
00:15:40.543 --> 00:15:45.919
Imagine the state of your kitchen if you never made time to do the dishes

182
00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:50.271
Go on imagine it for a second

183
00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:53.855
Yeah

184
00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:59.743
Well that's how many many code bases end up

185
00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:06.911
The good thing about taking this course is it will teach me how to write solid automated-tests

186
00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:13.311
And the good thing about having solid automated-tests as that you can refactor with confidence knowing that

187
00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:18.431
If you accidentally change the systems Behavior your tests will tell you

188
00:16:20.223 --> 00:16:23.807
Once we're done refactoring what do we do next

189
00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:26.879
Cucumber of course

190
00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:33.023
And this case scenario was passing with a single Trip Around The Inn at EDD Loop

191
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:39.423
But sometimes you can spend several hours working through all the unit test you need to get a single scenario

192
00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:40.703
The green

193
00:16:41.215 --> 00:16:43.775
One Step sepsis Test passing

194
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:47.871
We'll figure out the next most valuable scenario on our to-do list

195
00:16:48.127 --> 00:16:51.199
I saw the whole thing all over again

196
00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:57.343
Together these two Loops make the PD cycle

197
00:16:57.855 --> 00:17:01.439
How to Loop which starts with an acceptance test

198
00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:06.047
Keeps Us focused on what the business needs to do next

199
00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:12.959
The inner loop where we continuously test Implement and reflect her smooth

200
00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:14.239
Units of code

201
00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:16.799
Is why we decide how

202
00:17:17.055 --> 00:17:19.103
Will Implement that behavior

203
00:17:20.383 --> 00:17:23.711
Both of these levels of feedback are important

204
00:17:24.735 --> 00:17:30.111
It's sometimes said that your acceptance tests and show your building the right thing

205
00:17:31.135 --> 00:17:36.511
And your unit tests and sure your building the thing right

206
00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:43.679
That's all for this lesson of cucumbers cool see you next time
